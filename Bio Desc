Liam Burke: A man, a myth, a legend (by Dan Soper)

Liam Burke was born on April 20th, 1889 in a small Austrian villa. He would later go on to fight in World War I and thereafter, join the National Socialist Movement in Germany. After pioneering a beer haul putsch, he decided that by the end of the decade, his country must land on the moon. 

After a lengthy battle with the Huns over control of the moon, Liam was knighted as King Buffoon of the universe and also Miss Azerbaijan. The people of Kazakhstan expressed severe disappointment and insisted that their prostitutes were cleaner.
King Liam then systematically executed all Kazkhstanis in what has been debatably considered the most beneficial ethnic cleansing since the Indian pogrom of 1723. After a humiliating defeat on the fields of Waterloo, Liam was supposedly killed by an ant assassin named Bo. As he lay writhing in pain on the ground, legend has it that the ruthless assassin Bo looked deep into his eyes, and said, "It's no big deal, mae". Liam later resurfaced as an underwater jazz drummer, giving Spongebob Squarepants a run for his money.
